# The Python 2 package names
#
# No Python 2 pip package is available for Debian Bullseye.  There is
# one available for Bookworm, but when installed it forces the
# uninstall of python3-pip.  That isn't the behavior we desire, so we
# simply don't support Python 2 for package installation via pip after
# Debian Buster.
